### Why

This project plan to translate java to swift. J2objc is very nice project that can translate java to object-c with only loss very litte performace. swift code feather is very similar with java, that is my intension.

### Current Support

* Support all java7 control syntax and will add java8 block support
  
* Support  Java exception translation based on ErrorType
  
``` swift
  do {
        try testThrowStatement()
  }
  catch (let e as JavaException) {
  }
  catch {}
  defer {         // Like java finally
  }
```
  
* Support Java generic type
  
* Readable Code
  
  JDK Exception.java will be translated as follow.
  
``` swift
  
/*
  
   *This is generated by J2Swift, donot modify 
  
*/
import Foundation
  
public class JavaException : JavaThrowable {
  
   private static let serialVersionUID:jlong = -3387516993124229948

public override init()  {
  super.init()
}

public override init(_ detailMessage:String?)  {
  super.init(detailMessage)
}

public override init(_ detailMessage:String?, _ throwable:JavaThrowable?)  {
  super.init(detailMessage,throwable)
}

public override init(_ throwable:JavaThrowable?)  {
  super.init(throwable)
}

override init(_ message:String?, _ cause:JavaThrowable?, _ enableSuppression:jboolean, _ writableStackTrace:jboolean)  {
  super.init(message,cause,enableSuppression,writableStackTrace)
}

```

* Support Java generic type

### TODO
